Panoptes (Ancient Greek: Πανόπτης; English translation: "the all-seeing")

### What it it?
Operating system integrity checks made easy.

### How does it work?

##### First run:
Script parses paths specified in the variable and provided by command line argument and creates a hashes (currently sha256) of all files it finds. Additionally it saves the size and modification date of the file.


##### Next runs:
Script parses paths specified, lists all files and creates their hashes. Hashes are then compared with those generated by previous run. If hash does not matches - fail is generated. If all hashes match - system integrity check is passed.

### Capabilities:
There are multiple arguments that can be used to modify the script behavior.
 - `-p --paths` is accepting paths as an extension to those specified in the paths variable inside the script
 - `-v --verbose` causes script to show all files that passed the check. By default only failures are displayed.
 - `-d --details` causes script to show details of failures. Details contain hashes, dates and sizes of files.
 - `-o --override` allows to force the script to override the database, saving new index as database.

```
usage: panoptes.py [-h] [-v] [-d] [-o]
                   [-p [additional_paths [additional_paths ...]]]

panoptes.py [-v | --verbose | -s | --silent | -p | --paths ]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Show output for files that passed the integrity check.
  -d, --details         Show detailed output for files that failed integrity
                        check.
  -o, --override        This forces the creation of new database if some files
                        will generate new hash values.
  -p [additional_paths [additional_paths ...]], --path [additional_paths [additional_paths ...]]
                        Include additional paths.
```

### Example output
Failure:
!(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mnmnc/img/master/panoptes.jpg)[Panoptes failure. File modification detected]

Success with `-v`
!(Panoptes success with verbosity.)[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mnmnc/img/master/panoptes2.jpg]

### Database
Database is a simple csv file. Example content:
